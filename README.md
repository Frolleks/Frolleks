**I have my own README, am I cool yet? No? Aw.** Anyways, I will list a couple of good projects (that I've contrubted to):
- [Daksh777's SpotifyNoPremium](https://github.com/Daksh777/SpotifyNoPremium)
  
  "Want a break from the ads? Watch this short video to receive 30 minutes of ad free music." Yeah whatever but shut up.

In addition to that, Spicetify is cool, too.

  spotify is spicy and hot omg like bro its so hot

- [Powercord](https://powercord.dev)
  
  One of the good Discord client mods out there. It's lightweight, and for developers, its more comfy. I just don't like the usage guidelines, though.

- [Rikka](https://github.com/rikka-org/Rikka)
 
  A "do whatever you want" type of client mod. I like it.

- [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord/Aliucord)

  BetterDiscord on the go. Can't say a lot about this but it's a very good one.
